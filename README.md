# Error-Detection-in-Surgical-Video
This is a GitHub repository for the paper I wrote on error detection in surgery. The link for this is here: ........  The intention for this repository is to give simple instructions to allow you to follow the "method" section of the paper to reproduce your own version.

This methodology is taken from open-mmlab's [mmaction2 repository](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2) and as such is a more specified extension of their work using (model) to the dataset I used.

The other purpose for this repository is that while their repository is well detailed I had difficulty with following some of their instructions, this therefore offers alternatives for some of the issues I faced.
