# Error-Detection-in-Surgical-Video
This is a GitHub repository for the paper I wrote on error detection in surgery. The link for this is here: ........  The intention for this repository is to give simple instructions to allow you to follow the "method" section of the paper to reproduce your own version.//
This methodology is taken from open-mmlab's mmaction2 repository and as such is a version of that  applied to the dataset I used.
