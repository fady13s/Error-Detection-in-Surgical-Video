#Denseflow
Denseflow is a video extraction tool, which is necessary for preprocessing your data before training. It was created by open-mmlab and you can find their page on it and their install instructions [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/denseflow).

I however, struggled with installing it due to an opencv error (but screenshots of Cudaarithm?) it and as such have provided their instructions and the alternative I used.
